# AeroMOC

AeroMOC is a open-sourced Method of Characteristic program based on Python. Currently it is 2-D, and it is able to deal with non-isentropic flow. Below is functions available now:

- 2-D non-isentropic flowfield simulation via MOC
- nozzle profile design 
    - axisymmetric / 2-D planer maximum thrust nozzle (ideal nozzle)
    - nonsymmetric planer maximum thrust nozzle
    - axisymmetric / 2-D planer minimum length nozzle (Rao nozzle) (issued)
- boundary layer correction

The program is based on references below:

The program is initially developed by Yunjia Yang (yyj980401@126.com). It is also a option of the assignment of Prof. Yufei Zhang's (zhangyufei@tsinghua.edu.cn) curriculum "Advanced Aerodynamics".
